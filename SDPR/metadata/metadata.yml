name: 'SDPR: Prescription Recommendation with Syndrome Differentiation'
description: We propose a new four-partite graph modeling paradigm that enables prescription
  recommendation models to represent the four steps of SD. Based on this paradigm,
  we design a prescription recommendation model, SDPR, which includes four modules
  corresponding to the steps of SD. We introduce a graph neural network-based entity
  representation module to enhance symptom and herb representation. To address the
  challenges of modeling syndrome and therapeutic method information, we propose a
  symptom set aggregator and an herb set aggregator. Our pre-training strategy for
  inducing syndrome and the therapeutic method-aware contrastive learning framework
  can model the complex relationships among symptoms, syndromes, therapeutic methods,
  and herbs. Finally, we integrate these modules into a multi-task learning framework
  to complete the SD analysis. Experiments on a public prescription recommendation
  dataset demonstrate that our model accurately recommends herbs and retrieves existing
  prescriptions, showing that the four-partite graph paradigm enhances precise herb
  prescribing.
